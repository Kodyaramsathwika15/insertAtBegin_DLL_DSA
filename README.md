How do you insert an element at the beginning of a doubly linked list (DLL)?

To insert an element at the beginning of a DLL, first create a new node with the desired data. Then, set the new node's next pointer to the current head of the list. If the list is not empty, update the previous pointer of the current head to point to the new node. Finally, update the head pointer to point to the new node, making it the first element in the list. How does this process ensure the proper linking and updating of pointers in the DLL?
